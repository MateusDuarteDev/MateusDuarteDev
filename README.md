- 👋 Hi, I’m @MateusDuarteDev  
- 👀 I’m interested in data science, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and tech that drives real impact — especially in education and sports.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced data workflows, Flask for backend development, and how to scale AI solutions using multi-agent systems (like CrewAI).  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to data pipelines, AI-driven applications, and EdTech/Football analytics platforms.  
- 📫 How to reach me: mateus.dc@hotmail.com or via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateus-duarte-cavalcante)  
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him (ele/dele)  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m building an intelligent question analyzer that helps students identify their knowledge gaps using AI — and I’m just getting started.
